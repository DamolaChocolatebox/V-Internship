# V-Internship


Hello Everyone,

This repository has different branches (a branch for each member).

Kindly fork this repository and ONLY make changes to the branch assigned to you (the branch with your name).

The file names (of the jupyter notebok) should be your name and the week number. E.g brian_week1.ipynb

Upon completion of each project, upload the jupyter notebook used for the project in your branch and then create a pull request once done.


Projects are submitted once you initialize a pull request from your branch.

Subsequent tasks and datasets would be relayed in the slack channel.

Cheers!
